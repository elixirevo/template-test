# SvelteKit Static Blog Template

**English** | [한국어](docs/readme/README.ko.md) | [日本語](docs/readme/README.ja.md) | [简体中文](docs/readme/README.zh-CN.md)

A static blog template built with SvelteKit. The entire site is prerendered with `@sveltejs/adapter-static`, deployed to GitHub Pages through GitHub Actions, and edited as Markdown through Pages CMS.

## Stack

- SvelteKit and `@sveltejs/adapter-static`
- GitHub Pages deployment through `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Pages CMS configured by the root `.pages.yml`
- Markdown posts in `content/posts`
- DeepL translation sync in `content/translations/<locale>`

## Local development

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```

Pagefind builds its search index after the static site build. To test search locally:

```sh
bun run build
bun run preview
```

To refresh all configured translations locally, provide a DeepL API key:

```sh
DEEPL_API_KEY=your-key bun run translate:content
```

## Content structure

- `.env.production`: public deployment configuration
- `content/site.json`: fallback site metadata when environment values are empty
- `content/posts/*.md`: source posts with frontmatter and Markdown
- `content/translations/<locale>/site.json`: generated localized site copy
- `content/translations/<locale>/posts/*.md`: generated localized posts
- `static/uploads`: files uploaded through Pages CMS

`content`, `.env.production`, and `static/uploads` are owned by each blog. Application code remains in `src`, reducing conflicts when upstream template updates are merged.

## Post Markdown template

Create posts as `.md` files under `content/posts`. The filename without `.md` becomes the URL slug, so `YYYY-MM-DD-kebab-case.md` is recommended.

Write the introduction here.

## First section

The body supports regular Markdown.

```ts
const message = 'Code blocks are preserved during translation.';
```
````

Frontmatter fields follow these rules:

| Field         | Required | Format and behavior                                                                        |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `title`       | Required | Used on list/detail pages and in SEO metadata.                                             |
| `description` | Required | Used as the post excerpt and SEO description.                                              |
| `date`        | Required | Use `YYYY-MM-DD` or an ISO datetime. Controls publication date and sorting.                |
| `published`   | Optional | Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` to exclude the post from the build.                     |
| `category`    | Optional | Defaults to `Notes`. Register it in `content/categories` before selecting it in Pages CMS. |
| `tags`        | Optional | A string array is recommended. Register values in `content/tags` for Pages CMS.            |
| `cover`       | Optional | Public path relative to `static`; CMS uploads use `/uploads/...`.                          |

Tags are stored without `#` and displayed in the same form. An array is recommended:

```yaml
category: Technical
tags:
  - dev
  - git
```

A comma-separated string is also accepted:

```yaml
tags: 'dev, git'
```

Do not add `locale`, `sourcePath`, `sourceHash`, `translationSchemaVersion`, `translationSource`, or `translatedAt` to source posts. The translation script generates these fields. Update `content/translations` with `bun run translate:content` instead of editing generated files manually.

## Search

- `/search`: search in the source locale
- `/<locale>/search`: search in each configured translation locale
- Pagefind indexes post titles, descriptions, and bodies.
- Category, tag, and locale values are exposed as Pagefind filters.

## GitHub Pages setup

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Open `Settings > Pages` and set `Source` to `GitHub Actions`.
3. Confirm that the default branch is `main`.
4. Set `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in `.env.production` to the production URL.
5. Add `DEEPL_API_KEY` under `Secrets and variables > Actions`.
6. For DeepL Free, optionally add `DEEPL_API_URL=https://api-free.deepl.com`.
7. Configure site metadata and source/translation/release locales in [`.env.production`](.env.production).

For a project Pages repository, the build reads `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` and sets the base path automatically. The base path stays empty for a user or organization root Pages repository.

### Google Search registration

A GitHub project Pages site is deployed under `https://<owner>.github.io/<repository>/`. Search crawlers only treat `https://<owner>.github.io/robots.txt` as the standard host-level robots file, so submit the sitemap directly through Google Search Console.

1. Add the full deployment URL, including the trailing slash, as a URL-prefix property:

   ```text
   https://<owner>.github.io/<repository>/
   ```

2. Copy only the `content` value from the HTML verification tag into `.env.production`:

   ```sh
   PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=your-verification-token
   ```

   The build adds this tag to every page:

   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="your-verification-token" />
   ```

3. Deploy, verify ownership, and submit:

   ```text
   https://<owner>.github.io/<repository>/sitemap.xml
   ```

On a custom domain or an `<owner>.github.io` root site, the generated `/robots.txt` is at the host root and its sitemap declaration is valid. Keep the verification tag deployed to preserve Search Console ownership.

To test a base path locally:

```sh
SITE_BASE_PATH=blog bun run build
```

## Updating from the upstream template

Use a real GitHub **Fork** when you want to keep receiving template updates. A fork retains its relationship with the original repository and supports GitHub's `Sync fork` feature. A repository created with `Use this template` has independent Git history and is not automatically synchronized.

Commit your blog changes and confirm that the working tree is clean before updating. Preserve the blog-owned `content`, `.env.production`, and `static/uploads` paths when resolving conflicts.

### Updating a fork

Register the original repository once:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
git remote -v
```

Fetch and merge later updates:

```sh
git fetch upstream
git switch main
git merge upstream/main
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run check
bun run build
git push origin main
```

GitHub's `Sync fork` → `Update branch` works when there are no conflicts. A local merge is easier to inspect when conflicts are expected.

Resolve each conflicted file, then stage only the resolved paths:

```sh
git status
git add path/to/resolved-file
git commit
```

Run `git merge --abort` before committing if you need to cancel the merge.

### Repositories created with `Use this template`

These repositories cannot use `Sync fork` because they have no shared Git history with the original. For reliable long-term updates, create a real fork and move `content`, `.env.production`, `static/uploads`, and any intentional custom code into it.

If the independent repository must remain, register the original remote and cherry-pick only the required commits:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
git fetch upstream
git log --oneline upstream/main
git cherry-pick <commit-sha>
```

Merging all updates with `--allow-unrelated-histories` is not recommended because even matching files can conflict during the first merge.

## Pages CMS setup

1. Sign in to [Pages CMS](https://pagescms.org) with GitHub.
2. Select this repository.
3. Pages CMS reads `.pages.yml` and creates `Posts` and `Site settings` editors.
4. Saving content commits it to the repository; pushes to `main` trigger deployment.

The open `workflow_dispatch` event also exposes a `Deploy GitHub Pages` action in Pages CMS.

Current CMS rules:

- New post filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
- Uploaded filenames: normalized to safe slugs
- Categories: created in `Categories` before post selection
- Publication date: datetime with second precision
- Post list: descending by `date`

## Site configuration

Public values that differ per deployment live in `.env.production`. `content/site.json` is the fallback when an environment value is empty or local tooling does not load the env file.

```sh
PUBLIC_SITE_TITLE="My Blog"
PUBLIC_SITE_TAGLINE="Notes and essays"
PUBLIC_SITE_DESCRIPTION="A static blog built with SvelteKit."
PUBLIC_SITE_OWNER="Your Name"
PUBLIC_SITE_FOOTER="Built with SvelteKit."
PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=your-verification-token
PUBLIC_SOCIAL_X_URL=https://x.com/your-handle
PUBLIC_SOCIAL_GITHUB_URL=https://github.com/your-name
```

Store only source copy in `PUBLIC_SITE_TAGLINE`, `PUBLIC_SITE_DESCRIPTION`, and `PUBLIC_SITE_FOOTER`. Deployment generates localized values in `content/translations/<locale>/site.json`. Locale-suffixed variables such as `PUBLIC_SITE_DESCRIPTION_EN` are not used.

`PUBLIC_SITE_AUTHOR` is accepted as an alias of `PUBLIC_SITE_OWNER` and takes precedence when both are present.

## Translation workflow

1. Pages CMS stores source posts in `content/posts/*.md`.
2. GitHub Actions runs `bun run translate:content`.
3. DeepL is called only when a translation is missing, its source hash changed, or its schema version changed.
4. `PUBLIC_SITE_TAGLINE`, `PUBLIC_SITE_DESCRIPTION`, and `PUBLIC_SITE_FOOTER` are translated into `content/translations/<locale>/site.json`. Site copy uses automatic source-language detection.
5. Markdown bodies are converted to structured XML and translated with `tag_handling=xml`, `tag_handling_version=v2`, and `ignore_tags` so headings, lists, and code blocks stay intact.
6. Frontmatter `date` bypasses DeepL and keeps the exact source value.
7. Requests include custom instructions to preserve Markdown structure and frontmatter meaning where the target language supports them.
8. Generated files are committed under `content/translations/<locale>`.
9. Static building and Pagefind indexing continue in the same workflow.

Example configuration for Korean source content translated into English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic:

```sh
PUBLIC_SOURCE_LOCALE=ko
PUBLIC_TRANSLATION_LOCALES=en,zh,ja,ar
PUBLIC_RELEASE_LOCALE=en
PUBLIC_RELEASE_USE_TRANSLATIONS=true
```

To disable translation:

```sh
PUBLIC_SOURCE_LOCALE=ko
PUBLIC_TRANSLATION_LOCALES=
```

Default DeepL language mappings are built in. Override individual mappings with `DEEPL_SOURCE_LANG_<LOCALE>` or `DEEPL_TARGET_LANG_<LOCALE>`. Targets that do not support DeepL `custom_instructions`, such as Arabic, are translated without that option.

## Release workflow

- Each changed source post on `main` creates or updates a GitHub Release using a normalized `post-...` tag.
- Releases use the source post by default.
- With `PUBLIC_RELEASE_USE_TRANSLATIONS=true`, the release uses `PUBLIC_RELEASE_LOCALE` when a matching translated post exists.
- If the translation is missing, release generation falls back to the source post.

The initial browser locale follows these rules:

- Only the first visit to `/` checks the browser language or `localStorage.preferredLocale`.
- A configured translation locale redirects to `/<locale>/`; the source locale stays at `/`.
- Explicit locale paths such as `/en/...` or `/zh/...` are never forced back to the source path.
- The locale selector stores its choice in `localStorage.preferredLocale`.

## Giscus comments setup

Post detail pages include Giscus comments. Public Giscus configuration lives in `.env.production`:

- `PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO`: GitHub repository in `owner/repo` form
- `PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO_ID`: repository ID required by Giscus
- `PUBLIC_GISCUS_CATEGORY`: GitHub Discussions category name
- `PUBLIC_GISCUS_CATEGORY_ID`: category ID

These values are public configuration and are committed in [`.env.production`](.env.production):

```sh
PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO=owner/repo
PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO_ID=your-repo-id
PUBLIC_GISCUS_CATEGORY=General
PUBLIC_GISCUS_CATEGORY_ID=your-category-id
PUBLIC_SOURCE_LOCALE=ko
PUBLIC_TRANSLATION_LOCALES=en,zh,ja,ar
PUBLIC_RELEASE_LOCALE=en
PUBLIC_RELEASE_USE_TRANSLATIONS=true
```

Shell environment variables can temporarily override them locally:

```sh
PUBLIC_GISCUS_CATEGORY=Announcements \
bun run build
```

Setup:

1. Enable GitHub Discussions for the repository.
2. Select the repository and category at [giscus.app](https://giscus.app).
3. Copy `repo`, `repoId`, `category`, and `categoryId` into `.env.production`.

The site theme toggle synchronizes automatically with the Giscus iframe theme.

The deployment workflow uses `post:<slug>` as the Giscus `specific` mapping term and pre-creates one Discussion per source post with `scripts/sync-giscus-discussions.mjs`. Every localized route shares that thread. Discussion metadata prefers the English source or English translation when available and otherwise falls back to the source post.
